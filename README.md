**Introduction**
Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis project! In today’s competitive market, understanding why customers leave is crucial for any business. This project dives into customer churn data to uncover patterns and insights that can help companies improve their retention strategies.

**What You’ll Find Here**
This repository contains everything you need to replicate our analysis, including:

**Data Directory: **The dataset used for our analysis.
**Notebooks: **Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing steps, and machine learning model development.
**Source Code:** Scripts for data processing and visualization.

**Dataset Details**
We’re working with the Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle. It provides a wealth of information about customers, including:
customerID: A unique ID for each customer.
gender: The customer’s gender.
SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Partner and Dependents: Whether the customer has a partner or dependents.
tenure: How long the customer has been with the company (in months).
PhoneService: Whether they have a phone service.
MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges: Their monthly and total charges.
Churn: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).

**Project Goals**
Exploratory Data Analysis: We’ll dig into the dataset to discover trends and patterns related to customer churn.
Data Preprocessing: This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing the features for modeling.
Machine Learning: We’ll build a model to predict customer churn and see how well we can anticipate who might leave.
Insights and Visualizations: Finally, we’ll visualize our findings and model performance to communicate our insights effectively.
